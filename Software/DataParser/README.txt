This code represents the first stage in the development of an EMG signal analyzer from a device using ML.

This code implements:
	- connection to the web server that distributes the device.
	- data parsing in real time
	- saving data to pandas.dataframe.
	- data visualization.

To run the code, the computer on which the code is run,
must be connected to the local Wi-Fi network provided by the device.
